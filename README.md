# AI-Chat

This project is a simple web application that allows users to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It provides a chat interface where users can send messages, save chat history to local storage, and load or delete previous conversations. The app is built with React and TypeScript.

## Prep before clone the repo

To use openAIs API you need to make a acount at openai.com and after that you need to make your own API key. You will gain credits for free in the beginning to use the API. I followed this [Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart).

## To run the app locally

**Clone the repo on your own computer then enter the following in the terminal:**

- make sure to create you own .env and use your own API key. See example.env file.
- npm i
- npm run dev

## Tech stack

- ViteJS
- React
- TypeScript
- OpenAI API
